    Factory function to create a reactive operator that merges multiple per-object-type
    Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) and a global Activity-Entity Relationship (AER) model
    into a unified, synchronised object-centric representation. This operator must be placed
    downstream of the OCOperator in the pipeline.

    The operator listens to a mixed stream of:
        - "dfg" messages, containing per-object-type control-flow models (HeuristicsNet)
        - "command" messages, which dynamically activate or deactivate object types
        - "aer" messages, representing the latest global AER model mined from events

    It keeps track of the currently active object types, updates internal DFG repositories,
    and reconstructs a global OCDFG accordingly. Additionally, it prunes the AER model
    to reflect only activities and relations relevant to the active OCDFG, thereby
    maintaining semantic consistency across views.
